# Natours 🗺️🌲⛰️

This is a project created by Jonas Schmedtmann for his UDEMY course 'Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!'

# About the website ☀️🌊

This project emulates a travel company website, showcasing a variety of travel packages. The web is composed by richly detailed sections, with inspiring photos and video that attest to the high quality of the products. Users can read testimonials of satisfied clients and all the details of each tour, such as price, group size and accommodation types. With its contemporary design, punctuated by subtle animations and transitions, the website promotes a transformative user experience.

I had a lot of fun coding this webpage and I hope you enjoyed scrolling through it, and playing around with the features. I learned so many cool new things coding along with the instructor and I can't wait to use all these new css tricks in real webpages.

Cheers! ✌️
